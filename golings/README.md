> rustlings, but for Go.

Learn Go the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) way: **138 small,
broken-on-purpose exercises** you fix one at a time, from variables to
concurrency, current through Go 1.26. An interactive terminal UI re-runs each
exercise the moment you save and only lets you advance when the tests pass **and**
`golangci-lint` is clean.

📖 **Docs & full curriculum: <https://golings.madhan.app>**

> This is a maintained fork of the original
> [golings by mauricioabreu](https://github.com/mauricioabreu/golings), rebuilt
> around a [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) toolchain, a Bubble Tea TUI, an expanded
> 46-topic curriculum, and a docs site.

## Quick start

This project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to pin the toolchain (Go 1.26,
gopls, golangci-lint) — you don't need Go installed globally.

```sh
brew install mise        # macOS; see mise docs for other platforms
git clone https://github.com/madhank93/golings
cd golings
mise install             # provisions Go, gopls, golangci-lint
mise run watch           # build + launch the interactive TUI
```

That's it. The TUI highlights the next unfinished exercise — open the file, make
it compile / pass its tests, remove the `// I AM NOT DONE` marker, and save.

### GitHub Codespaces

Open the repo in a Codespace (or VS Code **Dev Containers**). The devcontainer
installs mise and provisions the same pinned toolchain, then `mise run watch`.

## Working through the exercises

Exercises live in `exercises/<topic>/`. Each topic has a README with resources —
read it before you start.

In the watch TUI:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `↑` / `↓` (or `k` / `j`) | move between exercises |
| `⏎` | run the selected exercise |
| `e` | open the exercise in `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` (falls back to `vi`) |
| `h` | toggle the hint |
| `r` | reset the exercise to its original state |
| `n` | jump to the next unfinished exercise |
| `/` | search exercises by name or topic (`⏎` runs the match, `Esc` cancels) |
| `q` | quit |

## Common commands

```sh
mise run watch           # interactive watch loop (the main one)
mise run list            # list every exercise + your progress
mise run update          # pull latest changes without losing your progress
mise run test            # test the tool itself (-race)
mise run lint            # lint the tool source
mise run site            # run the docs site locally
```

`mise run update` shelves your in-progress edits, pulls, then restores them. Your
completion record (`.golings-state.json`) is untracked, so your done count and
streak survive every update.

## Getting unstuck

Help escalates so you take only what you need: the `// FIXME` comment in each
file nudges you toward *what* to do; the hint (`h`, or `./bin/golings hint
<name>`) shows the actual code; and the [`solution`](https://github.com/madhank93/golings/tree/solution)
branch has the full worked answer for every exercise — e.g.
`git show solution:exercises/variables/variables1/main.go`. Try the first two
before peeking.

## Editor setup (VS Code)

The repo ships a `.vscode/` config. On open, VS Code prompts you to install the
recommended **Go** and **mise** extensions — accept both and reload. The config
points the Go extension straight at mise's `go`/`gopls`, so completion,
hover, go-to-definition, format-on-save, and `golangci-lint` work even when
VS Code is launched outside a mise shell. (If nothing works, reload the window
after the Go extension finishes installing its tools.)

Note: an unsolved exercise is **broken on purpose**, so it doesn't compile —
gopls can't offer completion or go-to-definition inside a file until you fix it
enough to compile. That's expected; IntelliSense kicks in as the code becomes
valid.
